This README file is for the data preprocessing of our datasets!!!

In this project, we use two Datasets which are PASCAL VOC 2012 Dataset and SBD Semantic Segmentation Dataset which is an augmented version of VOC 2012 Dataset.

These four python files are used to to convert the label images of mat format into the png format, and then converted from grey images to color images.

Codes are adapted from Github:
